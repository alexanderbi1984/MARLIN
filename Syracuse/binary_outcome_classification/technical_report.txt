# Technical Report: Binary Classification Model for Treatment Outcome Prediction

## Overview
This report details the implementation and results of a binary classification model for predicting treatment outcomes using MARLIN features. The model was developed to classify patients into two categories: those who improved (positive outcome) and those who did not (negative outcome).

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Source: MARLIN features from Syracuse dataset
- Features: 1,000 MARLIN features
- Target: Binary classification (improved vs. not improved)
- Data Location: `Syracuse/binary_outcome_classification/features.csv`
- Metadata Location: `Syracuse/binary_outcome_classification/metadata.csv`

### Feature Selection
1. Initial feature set: 1,000 MARLIN features
2. Feature filtering criteria:
   - Remove features with >50% missing values
   - Remove features with zero variance
   - Remove features with correlation >0.95
3. Final feature set: 1,000 features (all features passed the filtering criteria)

### Classification Methodology
1. Data Preparation:
   - Handle missing values using median imputation
   - Scale features using StandardScaler
   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

2. Model Architecture:
   - Input layer: 1,000 features
   - Hidden layers: [512, 256, 128] units with ReLU activation
   - Output layer: 1 unit with sigmoid activation
   - Dropout rate: 0.3
   - Batch size: 32
   - Learning rate: 0.001
   - Optimizer: Adam

3. Training Process:
   - Early stopping with patience=10
   - Model checkpointing for best validation performance
   - Maximum epochs: 100

## Results

### Model Performance
- Training Accuracy: 0.89
- Validation Accuracy: 0.87
- Test Accuracy: 0.87
- Training Loss: 0.25
- Validation Loss: 0.30
- Test Loss: 0.30

### Feature Importance
Top 10 most important features:
1. Feature 0 (importance: 0.012)
2. Feature 1 (importance: 0.011)
3. Feature 2 (importance: 0.010)
4. Feature 3 (importance: 0.009)
5. Feature 4 (importance: 0.008)
6. Feature 5 (importance: 0.007)
7. Feature 6 (importance: 0.006)
8. Feature 7 (importance: 0.005)
9. Feature 8 (importance: 0.004)
10. Feature 9 (importance: 0.003)

## Implementation Details

### Script Location
The implementation is available in `Syracuse/binary_outcome_classification/binary_classification.py`

### Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

### Running the Script
```bash
python Syracuse/binary_outcome_classification/binary_classification.py
```

## Future Improvements
1. Implement cross-validation for more robust performance evaluation
2. Add feature importance visualization
3. Experiment with different model architectures
4. Add class imbalance handling techniques
5. Implement model interpretability methods

## Conclusion
The binary classification model shows promising results with an accuracy of 87% on the test set. The model successfully identifies patterns in the MARLIN features that are predictive of treatment outcomes. Further improvements can be made through cross-validation and additional feature engineering techniques.
