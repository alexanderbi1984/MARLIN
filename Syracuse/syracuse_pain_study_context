1. The meta file path is '/Users/hd927/Documents/syracuse_pain_research/multimodal_marlin_base 2/meta_with_outcomes.xlsx'
2. the row names of the meta file are file_name	creation_time	duration	subject_id	pain_level	visit_type	comment	outcome
3. Please note that there are some non integer values in the col pain_level, you should pay attention. The range of pain level is from 0 to 10.
4. The optional values for col visit_type are 1st-pre, 1st-post, 2nd-pre and 2nd-post. Here pre and post means before treatment and after treatment.
5. The study is interested in how much pain level is reduced after the treatment. To be more specific, whther the reduction of the pain level is detectable using the features obatined from the facial expression videos.
6. The videos last about 1 minute for each and then the 5-second clips are generated from the video by slicing with 1 second overlap.
7. Each subject has at most 4 videos (1st-pre,1st-post, 2nd-pre,2nd-post), but not necessary has all 4 videos. There is a treatment before pre and post. 1st and 2nd means two separate sessions which are taken on different date.
8. The outcome cols store the binary ground_truth about the pain reduction induced by the differences of the pain_level of pre and post. And the threshold is 4 which is chosen based on the distribution of the data we have so far.
9. The pain level is self_reported.
10. The file name col stores the name of the video files, like IMG_xxxx.MP4 where xx is a serial number without any meaning for our study. 
11. We don't work directly with the video files. Instead we work with the features which are obtained from a pretrained video autoencoder. 
12. The features are fixed 768 dimentions and each feature file is associated to a clip of a video with name like "IMG_0111_clip_014_aligned.npy" where IMG_0111 denotes the clip is from the video IMG_0111.MP4 and clip_014 denotes it is the 14th clip.
13. The path to the features files is '/Users/hd927/Documents/syracuse_pain_research/multimodal_marlin_base 2'
